## How to read this repository?

I'm glad that you asked that ;). This repo has 5 top level folders `v0` - `v5`.
`v` stands for version. Inside each folder you will find a mini app with `index.html`
and a work-in-progress version of my `react.js`. Some of the folders have sub-versions
and each one of those is a mini app on its own.

Each folder has a `README.md` with a changelog of everything that has changed since
the last version.

Enjoy yourself,
Ofir
